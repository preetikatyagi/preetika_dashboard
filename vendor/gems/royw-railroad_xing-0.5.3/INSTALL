Installation Instructions

1) Install railroad-0.5.0 gem:

  sudo gem install railroad

2) Replace the railroad gem directory with this get repository:

  # clone the repository

  cd path/for/repository
  git clone git://github.com/royw/railroad.git  

  # replace the railroad system gem

  cd path/to/system/gems
  sudo mv railroad-0.5.0 railroad-0.5.0.orig
  sudo ln -s /path/for/repository/railroad railroad-0.5.0

That should do it.


Notes

1) Tested on Merb 1.0.4 and DataMapper 0.9.7.

2) Only generation for Models and Controllers is supported.  The AASM is a rails plugin so did not support AASM graphs.
There is a similar plugin for datamapper (dm-is-state_machine) if anyone wants to tackle it.

3) One caveat, RailRoad needs to be installed as a system gem, not installed into your application.  If you really must
have railroad installed as an application gem, then you will need to move:

from your_app/gems/gems/railroad-x.x.x/lib/railroad/merb_framework.rb:

    require 'merb-core'
    Merb.start_environment(:testing => true, :adapter => 'runner', :environment => ENV['MERB_ENV'] || 'test')

to your_app/bin/railroad after the require statements and before the gem directory stuff.

4) Example merb rake task:

your_app/lib/tasks/doc.rake:

  namespace :diagram do
    desc 'generate model diagrams'
    task :models do
      sh "railroad -i -l -a -m -M | neato -Tsvg | sed 's/font-size:14.00/font-size:11.00/g' >
doc/models.svg"
    end

    desc 'generate controller diagrams'
    task :controllers do
      sh "railroad -i -l -C | neato -Tsvg | sed 's/font-size:14.00/font-size:11.00/g' >
doc/controllers.svg"
    end
  end

  desc 'generate model and controller diagrams'
  task :diagrams => %w(diagram:models diagram:controllers)


5) The merb environment detection assumes that your application has a merb sub-directory (your_app/merb/).  The current version of merb-gen does create this sub-directory but older projects may need to:

  cd your_app
  touch merb
